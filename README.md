# vinay-portfolio
Designed and developed a modern personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my creative journey as a photo editor and photographer. The website features smooth transitions, responsive design, image galleries, and an engaging user experience that reflects my artistic style and technical skills.
